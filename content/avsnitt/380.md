Fredrik chats with [Sara Vieira](https://iamsaravieira.com/) about [The Opinionated Guide to React](https://opinionatedreact.com/) - the guide to making all the choices React doesn't make for you (plus hooks). We talk about the magic train ride from Prague which led to the creation of the book, what the writing and publication process was like, and of course about the surprising and horrific code Sara uses to create the final book files. We also discuss MC:ing conferences, what happens when world events explode all over your writing, finding your voice, and making the most of your [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) plan.
